**[Github](https://github.com/)** is an application that enables you to interact with GitHub using a GUI instead of the command line or a web browser. GitHub Desktop encourages you and your team to collaborate using best practices with Git and GitHub

## Understanding Git

The core of Github is the open-source software git, which is a distributed version control and source code management software. Github adds many features onto git's functionality, including issue tracking, wiki, access control, etc.

However, Github is proprietary software, and many of it's internals remain unknown to general public.

##  Getting started with your GitHub account

With a personal account on GitHub, you can import or create repositories, collaborate with others, and connect with the GitHub community.

This guide will walk you through setting up your GitHub account and getting started with GitHub's features for collaboration and community.


## Part 1: Configuring your GitHub account
---------------

The first steps in starting with GitHub are to create an account, choose a product that fits your needs best, verify your email, set up two-factor authentication, and view your profile.

There are several types of accounts on GitHub. Every person who uses GitHub has their own personal account, which can be part of multiple organizations and teams. Your personal account is your identity on GitHub.com and represents you as an individual.

### 1. Creating an account
To sign up for an account on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/), and follow the prompts.

To keep your GitHub account secure you should use a strong and unique password. For more information, see [Creating a strong password](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-strong-password).
# Creating a strong password
Secure your account on GitHub.com with a strong and unique password using a password manager.

You must choose or generate a password for your account on GitHub.com that is at least:

Eight characters long, if it includes a number and a lowercase letter, or 15 characters long with any combination of characters
To keep your account secure, we recommend you follow these best practices:

Use a password manager, such as LastPass or 1Password, to generate a password of at least 15 characters.

Generate a unique password for GitHub. If you use your GitHub password elsewhere and that service is compromised, then attackers or other malicious actors could use that information to access your account on GitHub.com.

Configure two-factor authentication for your personal account. For more information, see "About two-factor authentication."

Never share your password, even with a potential collaborator. Each person should use their own personal account on GitHub. For more information on ways to collaborate, see: "Inviting collaborators to a personal repository," "About collaborative development models," or "Collaborating with groups in organizations."

When you type a password to sign in, create an account, or change your password, GitHub will check if the password you entered is considered weak according to datasets like HaveIBeenPwned. The password may be identified as weak even if you have never used that password before.

GitHub only inspects the password at the time you type it, and never stores the password you entered in plaintext. For more information, see HaveIBeenPwned.

You can only use your password to log on to GitHub using your browser. When you authenticate to GitHub with other means, such as the command line or API, you should use other credentials. For more information, see "About authentication to GitHub."

When Git prompts you for your password, enter your personal access token (PAT). Alternatively, you can use a credential helper like Git Credential Manager. Password-based authentication for Git has been removed in favor of more secure authentication methods. For more information, see "Creating a personal access token."
### 2. Choosing your GitHub product
You can choose GitHub Free or GitHub Pro to get access to different features for your personal account. You can upgrade at any time if you are unsure at first which product you want.
### 3. Verifying your email address
To ensure you can use all the features in your GitHub plan, verify your email address after signing up for a new account. For more information, see [Verifying your email address](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-github/verifying-your-email-address).

### 4. Configuring two-factor authentication
Two-factor authentication, or 2FA, is an extra layer of security used when logging into websites or apps. We strongly urge you to configure 2FA for the safety of your account. For more information, see [About two-factor authentication.](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/about-two-factor-authentication)
